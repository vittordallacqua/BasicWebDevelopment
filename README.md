### The project for the Basic Web Development course aimed to create a website using the technologies covered throughout the semester, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We developed a “betting site” nicknamed Capivarinha, which features a navigation menu, responsive layout, and player registration and login functionalities implemented using the localStorage API.
